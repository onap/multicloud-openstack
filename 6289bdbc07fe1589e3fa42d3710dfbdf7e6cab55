      "message": "I guess your intention is to normalize the data model passing to _get_hpa_capxxx()\nI agree with your idea, but I would suggest re-think about the way to do that, \nspecifically, use array(or tuple) vs dict.  with array to passing parameters, \nthe handler of hpa_xxx have to locate the specific parameter by index, which is less straigtforward.\nInstead, if you could use a dict with key to pair with each parameter, e.g. {\"flavor\": flavor,\"xxx\":yyy}, it might be more straightforward for handler to access specific parameter.",
